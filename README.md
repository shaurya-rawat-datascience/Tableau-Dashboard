Analyzing Global Happiness Determinants Using Tableau
During my master's program, I led a team of four in a data analytics project aimed at understanding the socio-economic factors influencing happiness across countries. We utilized the World Happiness Report 2019 dataset from Kaggle, focusing on variables such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

Our analysis involved several key steps:

Data Preparation: We cleaned the dataset by handling missing values through imputation or removal and addressed outliers to maintain data integrity.

Normalization and Feature Engineering: Certain metrics were normalized to ensure comparability across countries. We also derived additional features, such as changes in happiness rankings over time, to provide deeper insights.

Visualization: Using Tableau, we created a comprehensive dashboard that visualized our findings. This included comparing the top three happiest countries with the bottom three, analyzing the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness scores, and exploring the correlation between generosity and perceptions of corruption.

Key insights from our project indicated that higher GDP per capita, robust social support networks, and lower perceptions of corruption are associated with greater national happiness. Our dashboard served as a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers to identify areas for improvement in less happy regions.
